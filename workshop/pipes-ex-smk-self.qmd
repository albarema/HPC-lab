It's time to create your own pipeline and experiment with its different components!

## A. Snakemake 

::: {.webex-check .callout-exercise}
# I - Build your pipeline from scratch 

- incorporate wildcards (several)
- config file for params and the path to dataset? 
- params software 
- log out // benchmark 

#### Resources 
- cores 
- resources related to size of the file 

#### Environment integration 
- conda env 
- create another smk with preprocessing to use include: 
- wildcards constrains?
