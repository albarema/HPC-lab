# II - Admixture analysis pipeline

Let's run the software `fastmixture` as a snakemake pipeline by converting the following bash pipeline.

#### Resources 
Specifying the number of used threads
- fastmixture: 4 cores 
- plotting results: 1 core 
- resources related to size of the file 

The number of K, will be determined in the config file so that the software can be used with other ks. 

#### Environment integration 
- conda env 

#### Set log and benchmark 

- Add a `log` directive to every rule. It is best practice to store all log files in a subdirectory `logs/`, prefixed by the rule or tool name.
- Add a `benchmark` directive as well. Applying the same best practice.
