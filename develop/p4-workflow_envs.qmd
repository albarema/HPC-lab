## Integration between workflows and software environments

Snakemake or Nextflow pipelines are essentially code scripts that require an appropriate computational environment to run properly. Let's explore the challenges of managing computational environments for workflows.

You can use a single common environment for all tasks in a workflow, which is generally recommended unless there are conflicting dependencies (for example, if one task requires a different version of a library than another). Alternatively, you might use separate environments if you're reusing a task from another workflow and donâ€™t want to alter its existing environment, or if a rarely run task has a large environment. In such cases, creating a dedicated environment for that task can help reduce the overall resource usage of the workflow.

Snakemake has built support for tasks environments: 

- Conda
- Environment modules 
- Singularity


**Nested environments with Docker for reproducibility** 

Two-level environment: 

- Outer container
- Inner container
