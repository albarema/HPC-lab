## Integration between workflows and software environments

Snakemake or Nextflow pipelines are essentially code scripts that require an appropriate computational environment to run properly. Let's explore the challenges of managing computational environments for workflows.

You can use a single common environment for all tasks in a workflow, which is generally recommended unless there are conflicting dependencies (for example, if one task requires a different version of a library than another). Alternatively, you might use separate environments if you're reusing a task from another workflow and donâ€™t want to alter its existing environment, or if a rarely run task has a large environment. In such cases, creating a dedicated environment for that task can help reduce the overall resource usage of the workflow.

### Snakemake 

Snakemake has built support for tasks environments: 

- Conda
- Environment modules 
- Singularity

```{.bash}
rule ...:
  conda: "path/to/env.yml"
  shell:
    "somecommand {output}"

```

**Nested environments with Docker for reproducibility** 
Two-level environment: 

- Outer container
- Inner container 

### Nextflow 

Enable conda directives in the pipeline configuration file (e.g. `nextflow.config`). 

```{.bash}
conda.enabled = true
```
Alternatively, it can be specified by setting the variable`NXF_CONDA_ENABLED=true` in your environment or by using the `-with-conda` command line option.

```{.bash}
process foo {
  conda 'bwa samtools multiqc'  # conda package YourNameSurname
  conda '/path/to/my-env.yaml'  # conda environment file 

  '''
  your_command --here
  '''
}
```

| Singularity/Apptainer | [Nextflow Containers](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/container.html#apptainer) |
| Conda               | [Nextflow Conda Integration](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/conda.html) |

It is recommended to specify environments in a separate configuration profile when possible to allow the execution via command line and enhance portability:

```{.bash}
profiles {
  conda {
    process.conda = 'samtools'
  }

  docker {
    process.container = 'biocontainers/samtools'
    docker.enabled = true
  }
}
```

This allows the execution either with Conda or Docker specifying `-profile conda` or `-profile docker` when running the workflow script.
