Key information you should seek from them includes:\n\n- The types of compute nodes available.\n- The storage options you can access and the amount allocated per user.\n- Whether a job scheduler software is in use, and if so, which one.

This command allows you to adjust and **manage the scheduling priority of your processes**, giving you the ability to run tasks with lower priority when sharing resources with others. By using nice, you can ensure that your processes do not dominate the CPU, allowing other users' tasks to run smoothly. This is particularly useful in environments where multiple users are working on the same system without a job scheduler to automatically manage resource allocation.\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-exercise}\n# HPC\n1.
