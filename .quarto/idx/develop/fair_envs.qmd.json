They are highly isolated, providing a separate environment for each VM. While VMs offer excellent isolation, they can be slow due to the overhead of simulating hardware and have large images that are cumbersome to share. VMs also require data transfer over the network to interact with the host system, which can be inefficient.\n:::\n- **Environment package managers**: provide an isolated environment with specific packages and dependencies that can be installed without affecting the system-wide configuration. These environments are particularly useful for managing conflicting dependencies and ensuring reproducibility. Configuration files can automate the setup of the computational environment: \n  - conda or mamba: allows users to export environment specifications (software and dependencies) to YAML files enabling easy recreation of the environment on another system. Conda disadvantage: long-term reproducibility. \n  - Python `virtualenv` or `pipenv`: is a tool for creating isolated environments to manage dependencies specific to a project.\n  - requirements.txt: may contain commands for installing packages (such as pip for Python packages or apt-get for system-level dependencies), configuring system settings, and setting environment variables. Package managers can be used to install, upgrade and manage packages. \n  - R's `renv`: The 'renv' package creates isolated environments in R.\n- **Environment descriptors**: refer to various types of metadata or attributes that provide information about the computational environment in which software or applications are running (e.g. `__version__`, `sessionInfo()`).

Processes within the same namespace can interact with each other, but they are isolated from processes in other namespaces.\n  - Control groups (resource management): manage and limit the amount of system resources that processes can use which ensures that they cannot exceed their allocation resources and helps maintaining the overall system performance and stability. \n:::\n\n\nWhile package managers are very easy to use and share across different systems, and are lightweight and efficient, offering fast start-up times, containers provide a full environment isolation (including the operating system) which ensures consistent behavior across different systems.

Below, we will explore two tools that can help with this: mamba, a package manager, and Docker, a container system. We will explain the differences between them and provide guidance on choosing the right tool for your specific scenario.\n\n## Package managers\n\n[Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a reimplementation of the Conda package manager in C++. While our focus will be on Mamba, it's important to note that it maintains compatibility with Conda by using the same command-line parser, package installation and uninstallation code, and transaction verification routines.\n\nMamba uses software installation specifications that are maintained by extensive communities of developers, organized into channels, which serve as software repositories. For example, the “bioconda” channel specializes in bioinformatics tools, while “conda-forge” covers a broad range of data science packages.\n\n:::{.callout-tip title=\"Mamba vs. conda\"}\nAs previously mentioned, mamba is a newer and faster implementation. The two commands can be used interchangeable (for most tasks). If you use Conda, you should still complete the exercises, as you'll gain experience with both tools. For more information on their ecosystem and advantages [here](https://medium.com/@QuantStack/open-software-packaging-for-science-61cecee7fc23). \n:::\n\nMamba allows you to create different software environments, where multiple package version can co-exit on your system. \n\n:::{.callout-exercise}\n# Build your mamba environment\nFollow [mamba instructions](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html) to install it. Let's also include `bioconda` and `conda-forge` channels which will come very handy. \n\n```{.bash .code-overflow-wrap}\nconda config --add channels defaults; conda config --add channels bioconda; conda config --add channels conda-forge\n```\nNow you are set to create your first environment. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a new environment named myenv\n2. Install the following packages in `myenv`: `bowtie2`, `numpy=1.26.4`, `matplotlib=3.8.3`\n3. Check the environments available \n4. Load/activate the environment\n5. Check which `python` executable is being used and that bowtie2 is installed. \n6. Deactivate the environment \n\n:::{.callout-hint}\nHere are some of the commands you need for the exercise. \n\n```{.bash}\nmamba create -n <ENV-NAME>\nmamba install --channel <CHANNEL-NAME> --name <ENV-NAME>\nmamba env list\n# mamba init \nmamba activate <ENV-NAME>\nmamba deactivate \n```\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-tip title=\"Solution\" collapse=\"true\"}\n\n1. The syntax to create a new environment is: `mamba create --name myenv`\n2. Example “bowtie2”: Go to anaconda.org and search for “bowtie2” to confirm it is available through Mamba and which software channel it is provided from. You will find that it is available via the “bioconda” channel: https://anaconda.org/bioconda/bowtie2. The syntax to install packages is: `mamba install --channel <CHANNEL-NAME> --name <ENV-NAME> <SOFTWARE-NAME>`\n\n`mamba install --name myenv --channel bioconda bowtie2=2.5.3 \"matplotlib=3.8.3\" \"numpy=1.26.4\"` \n\nDo the same with the others. \n3. To see al environments available `mamba env list`. There will be a \"*\" showi8ng the one is activated. \n4. Load the environment `mamba activate myenv`. \n5. `which python` -> should print the one in the environment that is active (path similar to `/home/mambaforge/envs/myenv/bin/python`). `bowtie2 --help`\n6. Conda deactivate\n:::\n:::\n\nIf you have different environments set up for various projects, you can switch between them or run commands directly within a specific environment using:\n\n```{.bash}\nmamba run -n <ENV-NAME> python myscript.py\n````\n\n:::{.callout-important}\n# Loading mamba environments in shell scripts\nIf you need to activate an environment in a shell script that will be submitted to SLURM, you must first source Mamba's configuration file. For instance, to load the `myenv` environment we created, the script would include the following code:\n\n```{.bash}\n# Always add these two commands to your scripts\neval \"$(conda shell.bash hook)\"\nsource $CONDA_PREFIX/etc/profile.d/mamba.sh\n\n# then you can activate the environment\nmamba activate myenv\n```\n\nWhen jobs are submitted to SLURM, they run in a non-interactive shell where Mamba isn't automatically set up. By running the `source` command, you ensure that Mamba's activate function is available. It's important to remember that even if the environment is loaded on the login node, the scripts will execute on a different machine (one of the compute nodes). Therefore, always include the command to load the Mamba environment in your SLURM submission scripts.\n:::\n\n## Containers\n\nEssentially, a container is a self-contained, lightweight package that includes everything needed to run a specific application—such as the operating system, libraries, and the application code itself. Containers operate independently of the host system, which allows them to run the same software across various environments without any conflicts or interference. This isolation ensures that researchers can consistently execute their code on different systems and platforms, without worrying about dependency issues or conflicts with other software on the host machine.\n \n:::{.callout-note title=\"Docker vs. Singularity\"}\nThe most significant difference is at the permission level required to run them. Docker containers operate as root by default, giving them full access to the host system. While this can be useful in certain situations, it also poses security risks, especially in multi-user environments. In contrast, Singularity containers run as non-root users by default, enhancing security and preventing unauthorized access to the host system. \n\n- Docker is ideal for building and distributing software across different operating systems\n- Singularity is designed for HPC environments and offers high performance without needing root access\n:::\n\nIn the following sections, we'll cover how to retrieve environment information, utilize containers, and automate environment setup to improve reproducibility.\n\n#### Singularity on a remote server\n\nWhile you can build your own Singularity images, many popular software packages already have pre-built images available from public repositories. The two repositories you’ll most likely use or hear about are:  \n\n- [depot.galaxyproject.org](https://depot.galaxyproject.org/singularity/)\n- [Container Library (Sylabs)](https://cloud.sylabs.io/)\n- [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)\n\n:::{.callout-note title=\"Installation\"}\n- [Singularity installation guides](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/installation.html#)\n\n```{.bash}\n# You will only need to vagrant init once \nexport VM=sylabs/singularity-3.0-ubuntu-bionic64 && \\\n    vagrant init $VM && \\\n    vagrant up && \\\n    vagrant ssh\n```\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n- We recommend using the pre-installed version provided by your system administrators if you're working on a shared system. If you're working on your own computer, you can install the necessary software using Mamba.\n- They might host different versions of the same software, so it's worth checking both to find the version you need.\n- To download a software container from public repositories, use the `singularity pull` command.\n- To execute a command within the software container, use the `singularity run` command.\n- Good practice: create a directory to save all singularity images together. `.sif` is the standard extension for the images. \n:::\n\n:::{.callout-exercise}\nDownload a singularity image from one of the two repositories listed above (choose a software like bcftools, bedtools, bowtie2, seqkit...) and run the `--help` command.
